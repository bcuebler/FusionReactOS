The programs are made for opencomputers, the client.lua  and the installer.lua work only in lua, however when the installer is done you has a programmed eeprom that you need to put inside a computer, and connect the reactor and the redstone i/o block or put in a card.

Here is the link for the Reactor controller server installer:
'wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcuebler/FusionReactOS/main/NCROS_installer.lua /bin/NCROS_installer.lua'

And for the client:
'''tag
wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcuebler/FusionReactOS/main/NCROS_client.lua /bin/NCROS_client.lua
'''
